# Libft ðŸ”¨ Under construction!

I made my own library in which I recreated functions from the standard C library. This is because we have to make everything from scratch in 42Wolfsburg. So in further projects we are allowed to reuse this and potentially other projects, like ft_printf and get_next_line. 

In my header you can find descriptions of all the functions! 
If you use a doxygen extension in Vscode you can also see these descriptions whenever you mouse over these functions.
