# Libft ðŸ”¨ Under construction!

I made my own library in which I recreated functions from the standard C library. This is because we have to make everything from scratch in the school I attend. So in further projects we are allowed to reuse this and potentially other projects, like ft_printf and get_next_line. 

In my header you can find descriptions of all the functions!
If you use a doxygen extension in Vscode you can also see these descriptions whenever you mouse over these functions.

In this project we learn about many concepts: creating a static library, using a makefile and a header, data type conversion, dynamic memory allocation, pointers vs arrays, memory functions, function pointers, file descriptors, 2D array or an array of strings, typecasting, guards, structs and linked lists.

## Functions:
| Ascii check | String | Memory | Linked list | Data type | Function pointer| other |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| isalpha | strrchr | memchr |  lstnew | putchar_fd  | strmapi| split
| isdigit | strchr | memcmp  |  lstadd_front | putstr_fd | striteri| calloc
| isalnum | strncmp |  memset |  lstsize | putendl_fd | |
| isascii | strdup | bzero | lstadd_back | putnbr_fd | |
| isprint | strlcpy | memcpy  | lstlast | itoa | |
| toupper |  substr| memmove |  strlcat | atoi |
| tolower |  strjoin|  |  | strlen| |
|  | strtrim |  |  | | |
|  | strnstr |  |  | | |
|  | strlen |  |  | | |
